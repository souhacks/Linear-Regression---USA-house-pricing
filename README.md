House Price Prediction with Linear Regression Involves Following Steps:

Dataset Collection: Gather historical house price data and corresponding features from platforms like Zillow or Kaggle.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering, such as converting categorical variables to numerical representations.
Splitting the Dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model building and evaluation.
Building the Model: Create a linear regression model to learn the relationships between features and house prices.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance on the testing set using metrics like MSE or RMSE.
Fine-tuning the Model: Adjust hyperparameters or try different algorithms to improve the model’s accuracy.
Deployment and Prediction: Deploy the robust model into a real-world application for predicting house prices based on user inputs.
